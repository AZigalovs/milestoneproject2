Using this as a user, I want to be able to find various locations for specific Autism therapies

## Testing

- Website has also been tested via Chrome Dev Tool for various devices and sizes

### Issues

Web page should have worked where each marker would provide information on specific location along with the results showing as a list on the right hand side. However, I have run into a problem, where markers do populate, with no information provided. Unfortunately, I could not figure out a fix for this.
